# Groq-Connect: Real-time Transcription and Translation Tool 🗣️🌐

## Project Description 📝

Groq-Connect is a real-time communication tool designed to facilitate multilingual conversations and meetings. It leverages cutting-edge technology 🚀 to transcribe spoken language, translate it into different languages, and provide additional features like sentiment analysis and summarization. This application aims to break down language barriers 🌉, improve meeting productivity 📈, and enhance communication accessibility ♿.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time Transcription:** Converts spoken audio into text with high accuracy. 🎙️➡️ ✍️
* **Real-time Translation:** Translates transcribed text into multiple target languages. ✍️ ➡️ 🌐
* **Multi-Participant Support:** Manages and displays transcripts for multiple participants in a conversation. 👥
* **Language Detection:** Automatically detects the source language of the spoken input. 🔍🗣️
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text (positive, neutral, or negative). 😊😐😞
* **Text Summarization:** Provides concise summaries of conversations or meetings. ✂️📝
* **Image Content Processing:** (Mocked) Functionality to analyze and describe image content. 🖼️➡️ ✍️
* **Noise Filtering:** (Mocked) Functionality to filter background noise from audio input. 🎧 ➡️ 🔉

**Note:** This project currently uses mock services for core functionalities (transcription, translation, etc.). A production-ready version would integrate with actual APIs like Groq's. ⚠️

## Technologies Used 💻

* **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, providing strong typing and improved code maintainability. 🔤
* **React (Likely):** Used for building the user interface (inferred from the project structure and styling, though not explicitly imported in the provided snippets).⚛️
* **Zustand:** A state management library for efficient management of application state. 🧲
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface. 🎨
* **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server. ⚡

## Installation ⚙️

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vanshaggarwal27/Groq-Connect.git](https://github.com/vanshaggarwal27/Groq-Connect.git) ⬇️
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Groq-Connect 📂
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install 📦
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev ⚙️
    ```

2.  **Open the application in your browser:**

    ```
    http://localhost:5173  # Or the port Vite provides 🌐
    ```

**Basic Workflow:**

1.  The application initializes and loads supported languages. 🌍
2.  Users can add participants to the conversation, specifying their names and languages. ➕🧑‍🤝‍🧑
3.  The application simulates recording audio, transcribing it, and translating it in real-time. 🎙️➡️ ✍️ ➡️ 🌐
4.  Transcripts are displayed for each participant, along with translations and sentiment analysis. 📄
5.  (Mocked) Functionality exists for summarization and image content processing. ✂️🖼️

**Important:** As mentioned earlier, the core services (transcription, translation, etc.) are currently mocked. To use the application with real-world data, you would need to replace the mock service implementations in `src/services/groqService.ts` and `src/services/languageService.ts` with actual API calls to services like Groq's. ⚠️
